## Goal:

## Background:
"Comparisons of developmental gene regulation between morphologically divergent animals, analyses of intraspecific variation, and the response of organisms and genes to selection all support the claim that regulatory DNA is the predominant source of the genetic diversity that underlies morphological variation and evolution. " -- Sean B. Carroll (https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(00)80868-5)

## Challenges:
- testing
- functional variation vs taxonomic variation
    - solution: band pass filter based on irrelevant nearby cis-regulatory regions??
- phenotype -genotype connection
- environmental plasticity
- Quantifying structural changes

## Short-term goals
- Identify project goal (Lol)
    - generate minimum sequence changes to reach target structure spec
        - overly ambitious
        - impossible to test
    - 
- Identify organism to focus on
   - Rodents (mammalian, variation in skull/limb)
   - Salamanders (lots of limb variation, closely related to each other)
   - Cichlids (lots of jaw variation, closely related to each other)
   - Zfish (lots of genetic info -- some variation)

## Resource:
- MorphoSource. 3D data repository. Contains CT scans. Has an API
- Gephebase -- collection of mutations and resulting phenotypes. Small but useful starting point
